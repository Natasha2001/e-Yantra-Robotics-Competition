## Theme: Supply Bot
##### The theme of the project is Flood Disaster Management using a “Supply Bot”.
The idea is to build a robot to provide relief aid to the affected district or cities. The relief aid to be received by the affected areas is communicated wirelessly to the robot using a camera. Once the robot has
identified the affected area, moving the relief aid as close as possible to the affected district or city is the primary task of the Supply Bot.
